Introduction

This project analyses student performance with different attribute analys. The project aims is to explore and gain insights from A comprehensive dataset containing different demographics along with their scores. My approach is to explore the database so that i better understand it, then visualize my finding using power bi.


To achieve the goal of this project, I have completed several tasks.

âœ… First, Download The Dataset from Kaggle.

âœ… Understanding the downloaded dataset properly.

âœ… Then I Checked whether the data sets contain null values, duplicates values, outliers, checking data types, spaces, and special characters and cleaned it.

âœ… Created different Charts, and Graphs ðŸ“Š to summarise the data and visually get quick information and make it easier to understand.

âœ… Finally, I built a dashboard in Power BI which allows users to interact with the data and view it in different ways.

What am i trying to do?

1. Ask Business questions
  
2. Start writing queries
 
3. Enhancement
   
4. Visualize finding in Power Bi
